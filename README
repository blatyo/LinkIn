Ridiculously scaled social networking.

This is a project for Cloud and Data Management course at RIT. The idea is to place this application on Amazon Web Services and scale it so that it can handle a lot of requests. We'll be using techniques like sharding and master slave replication to allow the database to scale. Then, to scale the application, new instances can be created pointing to the same database setup. This would allow huge scaling vertical possibilities. Of course we're pre-optimizing for usage that will probably never exist, so don't take this as a serious implementation of social networking, but rather a test to see what is possible when scaling web applications.
